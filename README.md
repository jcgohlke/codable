# Codable

This is a playground to showcase the addition of the `Codable` protocol in Swift 4 for use in JSON parsing. It was presented at the [Orlando iOS Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-iOS-Developer-Group/events/247202312/) on February 21, 2018 and has been tested with Xcode 9.2.

The playground is multi-page and well documented, so please clone this repo and open the playground in Xcode for additional details.
